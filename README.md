The "News" application consists of a mobile application suitable for Android systems, which will be built through Visual Studio and is easily accessible
and installable for different android versions.
This is a simple, fast application in which we can be informed about various events in the world. The application will have different menus that will consist of the fields of life, business, entertainment, economy, showbizz etc. There will also be a search field for the user to search for a specific news that he is interested in.
Ledia and Klea will deal with the development of the software,Rei will deal with the software design part and Elisabeta will deal with the maintenance part.But these are not the final tasks as each of us can work with each other to help the other member.
