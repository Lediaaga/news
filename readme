Welcome to NewsApp! This is the README file for the NewsApp website. The project is built using PHP
and is designed to be run locally using XAMPP.

Description

sources. It utilizes PHP as the server-side scripting language to provide dynamic content and interact
with the database.

3. Locate the XAMPP installation directory and navigate to the htdocs folder.
4. Copy all the files and folders from the project repository and paste them into the htdocs folder.
5. Put all the saved images in a folder named ‘img’.
6. Open XAMPP and start the Apache and MySQL services.
7. Launch a web browser and enter http://localhost/newsapp in the address
bar.

these steps:

1. Open the project folder located in the htdocs directory of XAMPP.
2. Look for a configuration file and open it in a text editor.
3. Modify the necessary variables or settings according to your local environment. For example, if
